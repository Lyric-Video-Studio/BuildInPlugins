# Lyric Video Studio built-in / example plugins
Plugins that are build-in in [Lyric Video Studio](https://lyricvideo.studio/) Microsoft Store version. Steam users need to download these plugins manually in order to use them (because of very strict rules about AI in steam). These should be used as example for creating own plugins. Please see the plugin interface repo https://github.com/Lyric-Video-Studio/PluginInterface
